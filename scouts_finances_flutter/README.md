# scouts_finances_flutter

The flutter frontend for the Scouts Finances project.
This project is built using [Serverpod](https://serverpod.dev), a backend framework for Dart and Flutter.

## Getting Started

A great starting point for learning Serverpod is their documentation site at:
[https://docs.serverpod.dev](https://docs.serverpod.dev).

To run the project, first make sure that the server is running (see the [README](../scouts_finances_server/README.md)), then do:

    flutter run
